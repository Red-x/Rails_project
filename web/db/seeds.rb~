# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  users = users.create( username: 'admin', password: 'cse2017', email: 'admin@rails.dev', year:'3')
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
